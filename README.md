## 📚 Course Overview

This course is all about **NLP from the foundations to modern wizardry**, with some AI magic sprinkled in.  
Here’s what we’re going to cover:

### Part I – Foundations
- **Data Preparation & Tokenization** ✂️📝  
  - Cleaning, preprocessing, tokenization strategies  
  - Stopwords, stemming, lemmatization, punctuation handling  
- **N-Gram Language Models** 📊  
  - Unigram, bigram, trigram models  
  - Smoothing techniques (Laplace, Good-Turing)  
- **Vector Semantics & Embeddings** 🧠  
  - Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText  
  - Cosine similarity, analogies, and semantic operations  
- **Sequence Models: RNNs & LSTMs** 🔄  
  - Vanishing gradient problem  
  - LSTM and GRU cells  
- **Transformers** ⚡  
  - Attention mechanism  
  - Encoder-decoder architectures  
  - BERT, GPT, and other pretrained models

### Part II – Modern NLP
- **Prompting & In-Context Learning** 💬  
  - Zero-shot, few-shot, and in-context learning  
  - Prompt engineering best practices  
- **Fine-Tuning Deep Dive** 🛠️  
  - Transfer learning, adapters, LoRA  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** 📚🔍  
  - Hybrid search + generative pipelines  
- **Evaluation Metrics** 📏  
  - Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, F1  
- **Deployment & Optimization** 🚀  
  - Model serving, scaling, inference optimization, GPU/CPU trade-offs

### Part III – Speech Integration
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech systems 🗣️🎧  
- Preprocessing audio, feature extraction (MFCC, spectrograms)  
- Integrating with NLP pipelines

## 📂 Folder Guidelines

### **syllabuses**
- Each part has its own folder.
- Each topic has subfolders for:
  - **notes** 📝 – summarized concepts, handwritten scribbles, explanations  
  - **code** 💻 – experiments, examples, model demos  
  - **exercises** 🏋️ – mini exercises, small projects

### **research-papers**
- PDFs or links to papers  
- Include a `README.md` with summary, key insights, and comments

### **projects**
- Each project will have:
  - `README.md` with description & goals  
  - `code/` folder for scripts  
  - `results/` folder for outputs, plots, evaluation metrics  
  - `notes/` folder for methodology explanations

### **resources**
- Datasets, cheat sheets, online tutorials, and videos  
- Color-coded markdowns: 🌟 high priority, ⚡ medium, 📌 optional

### **misc**
- Experiments that may or may not work 😅  
- Fun side projects, memes, or interesting NLP hacks
