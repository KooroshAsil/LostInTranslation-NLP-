# 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Course Project

Welcome to the repository for our **NLP course project** on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. This project is designed to explore, analyze, and document one of the most impactful methods for improving the reliability and factuality of large language models.

The repository serves two purposes:

1. To provide a clear explanation of our project, objectives, and references.
2. To track our step-by-step progress throughout the course.

## ✨ What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines:

* **Retrieval**: Accessing external knowledge bases, vector stores, or text corpora.
* **Generation**: Using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce answers.

By integrating retrieval with generation, RAG systems can generate responses that are **factually grounded**, **up-to-date**, and more **reliable** compared to models that rely only on pre-trained memory.

## 🏆 Core References

The project is grounded on three foundational papers:

1. **[Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)** – Lewis et al., 2020
   Introduces the concept of RAG and demonstrates its utility in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.

2. **[Atlas: Few-shot Learning with Retrieval Augmented Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03299)** – Izacard et al., 2022
   Extends RAG to few-shot learning scenarios, showing its value when limited data is available.

3. **[In-Context RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Contextualized Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05221)** – Borgeaud et al., 2022
   Explores scaling RAG for large models and industry applications.

These papers form the **theoretical and practical backbone** of our project.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Develop a deep understanding** of RAG and its significance in modern NLP.
2. **Examine and analyze** the above three papers in detail to answer theoretical and practical questions.
3. **Bridge research with application**, identifying how ideas in the literature translate into real-world or industry-relevant use cases.
4. **Document progress and learning outcomes** in a structured and clear way.
